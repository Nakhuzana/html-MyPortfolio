    <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
    <P>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                I grew up as a young man very curious about what happens behind the scene, I remember watching a movie and checking behind the TV to see how those people fit inside a small instrument. I started to wonder how all these gadgets work and how is it possible that we can you use all the technology and how does it come about?<br />
                From this I started growing the passion for technology and knowledge, and I wanted to create or invest something amazing one day.
            </LI>
            <li> But as I grew up and having knowledge about this, I then realized that, I need to understand the physical part that make up technology, which is why I studied Electronics Engineering, before I took in a field of programming.
            <br /> 
            </li>
            Best thing about this was that even during my undertaking for electronics, I was introduced to programming skills, and just like that everything came along together nicely
            <li>It is best to mention that, I went to varsity not understanding english language as I went to a low education government public school. <br />
            I remember everything from high school to varsity, I have to go home and teach myself, so that I can learn and understand what was being taught. <br />
            This was a very difficult journey, such that back in varsity, I would ask my classmates who went to private college with good English skills how they 
            got the question wrong when they understood the question. The reason being that, this was my reason for not getting the answers correct: I could not understand what the question was asking.
            </li>
            <li>In this project, you will get to understand about the person behing the computer and designing the website, so that when you decide to up that offer you understand the product</li>
